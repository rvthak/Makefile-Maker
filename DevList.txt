+ Dev list:

1) Change the final executable name to mfmk for simplicity
2) Turn the final release into a .deb package to make installation easier
and make the program executable from any directory if possible
3) When the program runs always check if make + the selected compiler are
installed in the system
4) If a makefile already exists on the current directory, the program will ask
if the user wants to edit the existing one or make a new one ( add the ability 
to parse an already existing makefile)
5) Implement "-org"
