+ Created 0.1 13/03/2019
+ Version 0.2 29/03/2019
+ Version 1.0 16/05/2020

Known bug/issues
1) If the program is Terminated with ctrl + C during file selection phase it leaves behind 
a file mkfl.tmp ( The file will be auto deleted next time the program runs + does not affect
the program at all) Maybe create the temp file in a linux global tmp directory ??
